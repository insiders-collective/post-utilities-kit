# Insiders Collective Post Utilities Kit

Duplicates posts and sets them to Draft for editing. Redirects to canonical URL when in Draft. Duplicates get end dates, and after that date reverts to Draft.

## Installation

To upload the plugin through WordPress, instead of FTP:

1. Upload the downloaded zip file on the 'Add New' plugins screen (see the 'Upload' tab) in your WordPress admin area and activate.

## Usage
* Hover over a post and choose Duplicate.
* Edit the new post as you wish
* Set a date at the bottom of the page for expiration
* Publish the post
